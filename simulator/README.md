# NVESM2 Simulator

This directory contains the simulation framework for **NVESM2**, adapted from
the original M2XFP simulator. It uses a BitFusion-style mixed-precision
accelerator model with CACTI-backed SRAM energy modeling. The currently wired
accelerator configs are `nvesm2`, `ant`, `mant`, and `olive`.

## Installation

We recommend using Conda to manage the environment.

```shell
$ # Environment.
$ conda create -n nvesm2_sim python=3.10.14
$ conda activate nvesm2_sim
$ pip install -r  requirements.txt

$ # Cacti for the memory simulation.
$ git clone https://github.com/HewlettPackard/cacti ./accelerator/sram/cacti/
$ make -C ./accelerator/sram/cacti/
```

## Methodology & Configuration

### 1. ISO-Accuracy Alignment
Different accelerators use varying quantization strategies. To ensure a fair comparison, we align all baselines to a target accuracy. Consequently, the bit-widths for each model layer differ across accelerators.
* **Configuration:** Layer-wise bit-widths are defined in `benchmarks/accel_model_configs.py`.

### 2. ISO-Area Hardware Configuration
The configuration files in `configs/accelerator/` (`conf_*.ini`) define the hardware parameters (Buffer size, PE count, Bandwidth).
* **Design Principle:** We align configurations based on **ISO-Area** constraints. Lower precision units allow for higher parallelism within the same area budget.
* **Example:** An 8-bit baseline (e.g., ANT) is configured as a **16x16** systolic array, while a 4-bit accelerator (e.g., NVESM2) scales to a **32x32** array.

### 3. Core PPA Data (Energy / Area for PEs)

Core (PE array) power/area comes from:
configs/ppa/systolic_array_synth_ant.csv
+ Used for ant.
configs/ppa/systolic_array_synth_olive.csv
+ Used for olive.
configs/ppa/systolic_array_synth_mant.csv
+ Used only for mant, whose PE tile implementation differs.
configs/ppa/systolic_array_synth_nvesm2.csv
+ Used only for nvesm2.

To ensure accurate power estimation, we use 45nm synthesis data:
+ NVESM2: `rtl_area_power/vsrc/nvesm2/pe_tile_v/pe_tile_nvfp_fp32.v`

The power of PE
+ Baselines (ANT, OliVe, MANT): Derived from their synthesized 8-bit x 8-bit PE.
+ NVESM2: Derived by synthesizing its FP4 PE tile and normalizing the eight-lane tile to a single PE.

## Running the Simulator

How to run:
```shell
python run_simulator.py \
  --models llama3_8b \
  --accelerators olive,ant,mant,nvesm2 \
  --normalized-bench olive \
  --batch-size 1
```

Aggregated, normalized summary is written to the legacy-named
`results/m2xfp_res.csv`.

This file includes the normalized data of accelerators across several LLMs.
